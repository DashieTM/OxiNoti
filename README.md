# oxinoti
A work in progress notification daemon made with rust and gtk.\
Can also be later used in tandem with oxidash, a notification center also made with rust and gtk.

## notes
- WIP, don't use this for regular use yet
- not sure if this is efficient, never had any proper experience with background tasks and/or async/parallel programming
